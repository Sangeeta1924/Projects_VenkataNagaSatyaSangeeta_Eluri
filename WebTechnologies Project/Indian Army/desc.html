Indian defence System(Idian Armed Forces):
<br/>
The Indian Armed Forces (Devanagari: Bharatiya Sasastra Senaen) are the military forces of the Republic of India. They consist of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Indian Coast Guard,supported by Paramilitary forces(Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force) and various inter-service institutions such as the Strategic Forces Command. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces. The Indian Armed Forces are under the management of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), which is led by the Union Cabinet Minister of Defense.
<br/>
<br/>
INDIAN ARMY:
<br/>
It is a completely voluntary service, the military draft having never been imposed in India. The army has rich combat experience in diverse terrains, due to India's diverse geography, and also has a distinguished history of serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Initially, the army's main objective was to defend the nation's frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially in insurgent-hit Kashmir and north-east. The force is headed by the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army, currently General Bikram Singh. The highest rank in the Indian Army is Field Marshal, but it is a largely ceremonial rank and appointments are made by the President of India, on the advice of the Union Cabinet of Ministers, only in exceptional circumstances. (See Field Marshal (India)). Late General S.H.F.J. Manekshaw and the late General K.M. Cariappa are the only two officers who have attained this rank.
The Indian Army has seen military action during the First Kashmir War, Operation Polo, the Sino-Indian War, the Second Kashmir War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Sri Lankan Civil War and the Kargil War. Currently, the Indian army has dedicated one brigade of troops to the UN's standby arrangements. Through its large, sustained troop commitments India has come in for much praise for taking part in difficult operations for prolonged periods. The Indian Army has participated in several UN peacekeeping operations, including the ones in Cyprus, Lebanon, Congo, Angola, Cambodia, Vietnam, Namibia, El Salvador, Liberia, Mozambique and Somalia. The army also provided a paramedical unit to facilitate the withdrawal of the sick and wounded in Korea. The Indian Army has embarked on an infantry modernization program known as Futuristic Infantry Soldier As a System (F-INSAS).

INDIAN NAVY:
<br/>
The Indian Navy is the naval branch of the Indian armed forces. With 58,350 men and women, including 7,000 personnel of Indian Naval Air Arm, 1,200 Marine Commandos (MARCOS) and 1,000 personnel of the Sagar Prahari Bal,it is one of the world's largest navy.
<br/>
In recent years, the Indian Navy has undergone modernization and expansion with the intention of countering growing Chinese maritime power in the Indian Ocean and reaching the status of a recognized blue-water navy. New equipment programs include; the lease of a nuclear-powered submarine INS Chakra from Russia, the ex soviet carrier INS Vikramaditya and the first of the indigenously built Arihant class ballistic missile submarines by 2012, the first of the Scorpene class submarines by 2015 and the indigenously built aircraft carrier INS Vikrant by 2017. The plan in the near future is to have two aircraft carriers at sea at all times, with a third docked up in maintenance.[58] Other programs include the Talwar and Shivalik frigates and the Kolkata class destroyers, all of which will be equipped with the BrahMos cruise missile.
The production of INS Arihant makes the Indian Navy one of six navies world wide that are capable of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines - others include China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

INDIAN AIR FORCE:
<br/>
The Indian Air Force is the air arm of the Indian armed forces. Its primary responsibility is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during a conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Raj and the prefix Royal was added in 1945 in recognition of its services during World War II. After India achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the Royal Indian Air Force served the Dominion of India, with the prefix being dropped when India became a republic in 1950.
Historically, the IAF has generally relied on Soviet, British, Israeli and French military craft and technology to support its growth. However, in recent times India has manufactured its own aircraft such as the HAL Tejas, a 4th generation fighter, and the HAL Dhruv, a multi-role helicopter, which has been exported to several countries, including Israel, Burma, Nepal and Ecuador. India also maintains UAV squadrons which can be used to carry out ground attacks and aerial surveillance. India is also testing its own long range BVR air to air missile named Astra.and also building a Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) called Rustom.

WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION:
<br/>

India has been in possession nuclear weapons since 1974 and maintains a no-first use and a nuclear deterrence policy against nuclear adversaries.[citation needed] India's nuclear missiles include the Prithvi, the Agni, the Shaurya, Sagarika, Dhanush, and others. India has long range strategic bombers like the Tupolev Tu-22 M3 and Tupolev Tu-142 as well as fighter jets like Sukhoi Su-30MKI, Dassault Mirage 2000,MiG-29 and HAL Tejas capable of being armed with nuclear tipped bombs and missiles. Since India doesn't have a nuclear first use against an adversary, it becomes important to protect from a first strike. Presently, this protection is provided by the two layered Anti-ballistic missile defense system. India conducted its first test with the Agni-V, a MIRV ICBM, in April 2012.
India's Strategic Nuclear Command controls its land-based nuclear warheads, while the Navy controls the ship and submarine based missiles and the Air Force the air based warheads. India's nuclear warheads are deployed in four areas:
Ship based mobile, like Dhanush. (operational)
Land-based mobile, like Agni. (operational)
Submarine based, like Sagarika. (operational)
Air-based warheads of the Indian Air Forces' strategic bomber force (operational)
