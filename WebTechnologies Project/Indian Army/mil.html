The headquarters of the Indian Armed Forces is in New Delhi, the capital city of India. The President acts as de jure Commander in chief of the Armed Forces while de facto control lies with the executive. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is the ministry charged with the responsibilities of countering insurgency and ensuring external security of India. General Bikram Singh is the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), Admiral Devendra Kumar Joshi is the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) and Air Chief Marshal NAK Browne is the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).The Indian armed force are split into different groups based on their region of operation. The Indian Army is administratively divided into 7 tactical commands, each under the control of different Lieutenant Generals. The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two functional commands. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The Indian Navy operates three Commands. Each Command is headed by a Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the rank of Vice Admiral. There are two joint commands whose head can belong to any of the three services. These are the Strategic Forces Command and the Andaman and Nicobar Command. The lack of an overall military commander has helped keep the Indian Armed Forces under civilian control, but it has also lead to problems in coordination of strategy.[not in citation given] </br>
The Armed Forces have six main tasks; To assert the territorial integrity of India. To defend the country if attacked by a foreign nation. To send own amphibious warfare equipment to take the battle to enemy shores. Cold Start which means Indian Armed Forces being able to quickly mobilise and take offensive actions without crossing the enemy's nuclear-use threshold. To support the civil community in case of disasters (e.g. flooding). Participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations in consonance with India’s commitment to the United Nations Charter. There is a semi-official book called "Customs and Etiquette in the Services", written by retired Major General Ravi Arora, which details how Indian personnel are expected to conduct themselves generally. Arora is an executive editor of the Indian Military Review. </br>
